# Music Player system with Finite State Machine

in this respiporitary it will contain a music player system with finite state machine application. This includes C languange implentation.
A music player FSM (finite state machine) is a system that controls the behavior of a music player by transitioning between different states based on inputs and outputs.

## States

1.  **Stopped**: The music player is stopped and not playing any music.
2.  **Playing**: The music player is currently playing a song.
3.  **Paused**: The music player is paused and not playing any music, but the current song will resume from where it left off when the player is resumed.

-   **Play**: `10`
-   **Pause**: `01`
-   **Stop**: `00`

## Inputs
the music player fsm accepts two 1-bit inputs:

**1** : PLAY AND PAUSE

**0** : STOP

## State diagram
below is the state diagram for the music player fsm:

## Truth Table
we can construct a truth table from the state diagram:

## Karnaugh map
We're able to to construct Karnaugh map for each of the states and outputs fromm the truth table.
from the Kmaps, we can also derive simpile Boolean expressions.
