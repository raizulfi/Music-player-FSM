# Music Player system with Finite State Machine

in this respiporitary it will contain a music player system with finite state machine application. This includes C languange implentation.

## Testing main program

A music player FSM (finite state machine) is a system that controls the behavior of a music player by transitioning between different states based on inputs and outputs.

## States

1.  **Stopped**: The music player is stopped and not playing any music.
2.  **Playing**: The music player is currently playing a song.
3.  **Paused**: The music player is paused and not playing any music, but the current song will resume from where it left off when the player is resumed.

-   **Play**: `00`
-   **Pause**: `01`
-   **Stop**: `10`

## Inputs
the system contains two input which is play/pause button repsented with: **P** 
and a Stop button repsented with: **S**

## State diagram
below is the state diagram for the music player fsm:



## Truth Table
we can construct a truth table from a state diagram:
